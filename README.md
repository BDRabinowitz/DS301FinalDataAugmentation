# DS301FinalDataAugmentation

This GitHub is an extension of the repository found at https://github.com/rohit-ravi2/visual-classification-ai-vs-human-art/tree/main, which includes testing that was done for potential Data Augmentation methods (Specifically Grayscale, Orientation Flipping and Central Cropping), with the primary goal of equalizing the model's performance on Human and AI art, as we found early on that CNNs were consistenmtly better at identifying AI art. However, in the end they did not produce the desired results to be included in the final cumulative model.

All models were run using the same data from the main repository.
